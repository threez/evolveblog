Testing and development are often taken apart as two separate things. I don't 
think these things are different. I am of the opinion, that testing and 
developing are two sides of the coin. One can't take away one of the other.
I further think that they should even equally weighted.

When i say equally weighted i don't mean, that the code for testing and the 
code for development has to be equal. I mean that the problem, its solution, 
the functions and the quality requirements are on both sides of equal importance.
Therefor they both should get the same time budget.

If you are developing on a feature for one day you should test it at least one 
day too. Testing more than that is not worth it, as far as my experience goes.

If you take apart these two facetts to scale out on two persons you will have 
to mention the following.

- They both should have mostly the same skill level. So the tester must be able
  to read and understand the code, architecture, interface, layout, style or what 
  not.
- They both should work in the same order
-- The Developer read the requirements, create a solution and implement it
-- The Tester read the requirements, create a testplan and implement/test it
- If the developers are working iteratively the testers should to
- Both should respect each other
- They should both be paid equally and rewarded equally

Sometimes is testing harder than developing and sometimes it's the other way
around. So that there is room to test more or less on a feature, as long as
the global time is equal.

If you shorten the time to test, you will grow the development time very fast
very quick. If you grow the testing time you will grow the inefficiency very fast
 very quick.

Because these Phases often occur already during development it's unlike that you
will have an equal amount of dedicated testers and developers. It's more like,
that some tasks are done by developer itself. What kind of test the developer is
doing depends on the problem.

I do like to call this kind of development *completely fair development*. If you
have any suggestions or questions please feel free to write comments.
